                            I always have a hard time answering and end up
                            saying something like "a variety". It really depends
                            on the context!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, I listen to a lot of ambient,
                            repetetive, instrumental stuff while working since
                            that helps me focus. But that's not a satisfying
                            answer, nor does it capture what I like in general.
                            There is music I enjoy live, but not listening to at
                            home. And stuff that I put on repeat for a month and
                            never touch again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, this little app aims to answer that question
                            from the top ‚òùüèª. I picked one track per genre that
                            might not be the best example of the genre itself--
                            rather it represents something I particularly enjoy.
                            Then you can continue on to related genres (and
                            their tracks).
                        </p>
                        <p>Please listen and enjoy! üéµ</p>
