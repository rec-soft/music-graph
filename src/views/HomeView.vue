                            I always have a hard time answering and end up
                            saying something like "a variety". It really depends
                            on the context!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, I listen to a lot of ambient,
                            repetitive, instrumental stuff while working since
                            that helps me focus. There is music I enjoy live,
                            but not listening to at home. And stuff that I put
                            on repeat for a month and never touch again. But
                            that's not a complete nor satisfying.
                        </p>

                            So, this little app aims to answer that question
                            from the top ‚òùüèª. I picked one track per genre that
                            represents something I particularly enjoy -- even if
                            it's not be the best example of the genre itself.
                            Then you can continue on to related genres (and
                            their tracks).
                        </p>
                        <p>Please listen and enjoy! üéµ</p>
